This is a project I created many many years ago when SDL was at 1.5 and google code was a thing (I saved the project by importing to github before google code shutdown)
I was trying to create a basic 2D game engine as way to get into the gaming industry.

I got hired before it was finished.

The engine (as I remember) could render layers, and scroll. It used tiled to create backgrounds and collision boxes.
It uses SDL and opengl to render, and has very basic input control and collision detection.

It was called dante2d because at the time I wanted to make a 2D version of devil may cry 3.

The last commit was made to get this running/compiling again and I added the .zip files of SDL 1.5 libs in case they disappear. 
But that's as far as I got.

Maybe one day I can finish this project. It is extremely outdated and written by someone who was just starting and learning to code at the time.

It use of C++ and SDL is hopelessly outdated. I hope it's educational and one day could be finished.
